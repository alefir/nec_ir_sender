# NEC IR SENDER

This is a small project to control an LED strip on my wall using a microcontroller and an infrared LED.

It's meant to work together with a companion phone app acting as a remote.

This project targets the [P-NUCLEO-WB55](https://www.st.com/en/evaluation-tools/p-nucleo-wb55.html) with the STM32WB55 bluetooth-enabled microcontroller from STMicroelectronics.

With the exception of [nec_ir_driver.c](./Core/Src/nec_ir_driver.c) and .h, this is almost entirely autogenerated by STM's STM32CubeIDE and their [SLA0044](www.st.com/SLA0044) license applies.

## How it works

The P-NUCLEO-WB55 uses Bluetooth Low Energy to broadcast and advertise a GATT server. The companion phone app transmits a 1-byte command to the microcontroller, which it then rebroadcasts using the NEC IR protocol to my LED strip.

The BLE event is handled at /STM32\_WPAN/App/p2p\_server\_app.c:35 and the IR rebroadcast is handled by /Core/Src/nec\_ir\_driver.c:36.

The OEM remote for my LED strip uses the NEC IR protocol, which Altium provides some [nice documentation](https://techdocs.altium.com/display/FPGA/NEC+Infrared+Transmission+Protocol) for, but here's a quick summary:

A logical 1 is a 562.5us pulse followed by a 562.5us space, and a logical 0 is a 562.5us pulse followed by a 1.6875ms space, both modulated onto a 38.222kHz carrier frequency.

Each code is structured as a 9ms pulse followed by a 4.5ms space, then the address and command, then a 562.5us pulse.

The address section is either an 8-bit address followed by it's logical inverse (for classic NEC) or the lower 8 bits followed by the upper 8 bits of a 16-bit address (for extended NEC).
Because a logical 1 and logical 0 are different lengths of time, the number of each in the address needs to be equal, which limits the extended address space to about 16,000 unique addresses.

The command section is an 8-bit command followed by it's 8-bit logical inverse.

All of the 8-bit sections of the address and command are transmitted least-significant-bit first.
